# PotentiallyIncorrectBallots
A searchable database of potentially incorrect ballots published by the Philadelphia City Commissioners, 11/5/2022

On November 5th, 2022, the Philadelphia City Commissioners publicly published lists of ballots that might be "Potentially Incorrect" for various reasons. [They published 4 pdf and 4 Excel files to their website](https://vote.phila.gov/news/2022/11/05/ballots-administratively-determined-to-have-no-secrecy-envelope-or-no-signature-no-date-or-a-potentially-incorrect-date-on-return-envelope/) with lists of mail-in-ballots that had potential problems. The [announcement read](https://vote.phila.gov/news/2022/11/05/ballots-administratively-determined-to-have-no-secrecy-envelope-or-no-signature-no-date-or-a-potentially-incorrect-date-on-return-envelope/):

*"all these ballot submissions have the possibility of NOT being counted. It is strongly advised that the voters on these lists request a replacement ballot at the County Board of Elections office in City Hall Room 140 on Saturday or Sunday from 9:00 am – 3:00 pm; Monday, November 7th from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm; or on Election Day from 7:30 am – 7:30 pm to avoid the potential rejection of their ballot."*

There are also instructions on the Commissioners site for people who cannot appear in person.

The databases they published were not searchable in a web browser. This site formats the data in a searchable tool.
